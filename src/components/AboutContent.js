            <p> 
                My goal is to use my work expertise and my time at KTH to better 
                the world through leveraging data, digitalization and technological 
                innovation. Although I'm currently not certain of how, 
                I am certain that one day I will. Other than that 
                I'm very interested in technology, finance, football, design, 
                and weightlifting. I grew up in Stockholm, but 
                like to travel at every available opportunity, 
                as I love meeting new people, discovering 
                new foods and new cultures. I've just finished my studies at Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gsklan (KTH), 
                obtaining a B.Sc. In Media Technology and a M.Sc. In
                ICT Innovation Human-computer Interaction and Design, that's why I'm now looking for my next challenge
                and hope to land a job that allows me to continue learning and improving.
